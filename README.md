🏠 House Price Prediction Model

📘 Overview

A machine learning project that predicts California house prices using the California Housing Dataset.
Includes data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and model training with Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor
Linear Regression: ~67% accuracy

Random Forest: ~83% accuracy

Random forest(after GridSearchCV tuning) : ~82% accuracy(lower than previous)


⚙️ Workflow

Data Cleaning – removed nulls, applied log transformations

EDA – visualized correlations and distributions using Seaborn

Feature Engineering – added ratio-based features and encoded categories

Modeling – trained Linear Regression and Random Forest

Tuning – used GridSearchCV for parameter optimization
